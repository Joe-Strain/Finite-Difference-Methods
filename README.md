# Fortran90
Code used for numerically solving the parallel plate problem (modeled as eliptic partial differential equations). Four finite difference methods were investigated; the accuracy and efficiency of each method was analysed and compiled into a report.

Methods:  
* Crank-Nicholson,  
* Dufort-Frankel,  
* FTCS (Forward-Time Central-Space),  
* Laasonen Method (aka BTCS Backward-Time Central-Space)  


The four method files: crank.f90, dufort.f90, ftcs.f90, laas.f90  
Module containing subroutines: fin_diff.f90
