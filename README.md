# Fortran90
Code used for numerically solving the parallel plate problem. Four finite difference methods were investigated, their accuracy and efficiency of modelling the parallel plate problem were all analysed and compiled into a report.

Methods:
Crank-Nicholson,
Dufort-Frankel,
FTCS (Forward-Time Central-Space),
Laasonen Method (aka BTCS Backward-Time Central-Space)


The four mehtod files: crank.f90, dufort.f90, ftcs.f90, laas.f90
Module containing subroutines: fin_diff
